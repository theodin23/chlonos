Chlonos is an electronic gadget with a brain, a display, some sensors and a voice.

It's something interesting to put on your wall. It can measure temperature and light, it keeps track of the time and will tell you about it all.

The processor is based on the Arduino Uno platform, the display is a LoL Shield and the speech engine is the SpeakJet chip. Various analog sensors and audio circuits have been cobbled together. The firmware has been developed in C using the AVR gcc compiler.

All hardware schematics and source code have been released as Open Source under the GNU GPL v3 licence.

Download the Arduino source code from the Downloads tab above and the components list can be found in the Wiki tab.
